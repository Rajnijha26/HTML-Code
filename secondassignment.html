    <p>Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on the enmity between the titular characters of a cat named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cat" target="_top">Tom</a> and a mouse named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Mouse" target="_blank">Jerry</a>.</p>

    <h2><strong>Tom and Jerry cartoon:</strong></h2>
    <p>The name <em>"Jerry"</em> was chosen by <i>Geraint Rowlands</i>, who submitted <ins>"Tom and Jerry"</ins> as potential names for the duo after an important Loews Inc. distributor in Texas asked for follow-ups to Puss Gets the Boot. While the idea of a cat-and-mouse duo was considered shopworn by the 1940s, Hanna and Barbera decided to expand upon the standard expected cat and mouse relationship. Instead of being a <strong>"cowering victim"</strong> of Tom, he took delight in besting, and even torturing, his feline frenemy (even if Tom is just following orders or is even just minding his own business and is antagonized by Jerry). Hanna and Barbera considered Tom and Jerry <u>"the best of enemies"</u>, whose rivalry hid an unspoken amount of mutual caring and respect for one another.</p>

    <h2>Plot:<a href="https://youtu.be/Mstx_8Y2Wps?si=vZ0TiLAEXLrHUQ15"><img src="image/tomjerry.png" width="100%" alt=""></a></h2> 
    <p>The series features comic fights between an iconic set of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a house mouse (Jerry). The plots of many shorts are often set in the backdrop of a house, centering on Tom (who is often enlisted by a human) trying to capture Jerry, and the mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, on several occasions, they have displayed genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escapes the watch of a negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger, in the shorts Busy Buddies and Tot Watchers respectively. Despite their endless attacks on one another, they have saved each other's lives every time they were truly in danger, except in The Two Mouseketeers, which features an uncharacteristically morbid ending, and Blue Cat Blues, where both sit on a railroad track at the end after being jilted by girlfriends. The cartoon irises out with the whistle of an oncoming steam train.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry">Read more</a></p>
